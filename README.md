# Siemens Mobility Project Management Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains my work on the **Siemens Project Manager Simulation** hosted on Forage.  
The simulation focuses on **project management in rail infrastructure**, where I assumed the role of a Project Manager at Siemens Mobility.  

The simulated project scenario:  
> **Urban Rail Expansion Initiative** – Designed to enhance the city’s public transportation network to meet increasing demands and achieve sustainability goals.  

My tasks included planning, monitoring, and reporting project progress with a focus on safety, efficiency, and sustainability.
