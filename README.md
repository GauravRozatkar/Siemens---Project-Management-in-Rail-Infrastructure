Siemens Mobility - Urban Rail Expansion Project Simulation
This repository contains the project management artifacts developed as part of the Siemens Project Manager virtual experience on Forage. The focus of this simulation is on the strategic planning, monitoring, and reporting for a major urban rail expansion project.

1. Project Overview
The project is an urban rail expansion initiative designed to enhance a city's public transportation network. The primary drivers for this expansion are to meet growing ridership demands, improve connectivity, and achieve significant sustainability goals. As a Project Manager at Siemens Mobility, my role is to steer this project towards its objectives through meticulous planning, the development of relevant performance indicators, and transparent communication with all stakeholders.

2. My Role: Project Manager
Within a dedicated team at Siemens Mobility, a leader in innovative rail infrastructure, my responsibilities include:

Detailed Planning: Structuring project timelines, milestones, and resource allocation.

Monitoring & Control: Tracking progress against the project plan, identifying risks, and implementing mitigation strategies.

Reporting: Developing and maintaining project dashboards and reports to ensure all stakeholders are informed of the project's status, challenges, and successes.

3. Core Objectives & Tasks
The simulation is divided into two key tasks that are crucial for the successful management of the rail expansion project.

Task 1: Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Development
The goal is to establish a robust set of KPIs to measure project performance against its core objectives. These KPIs are categorized into three critical areas:

Safety: Ensuring the well-being of the construction crew, engineers, and the public.

Examples: Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), Number of safety drills conducted.

Efficiency: Measuring the project's adherence to schedule, budget, and scope.

Examples: Schedule Performance Index (SPI), Cost Performance Index (CPI), Milestone Completion Rate.

Sustainability: Tracking the project's environmental and social impact.

Examples: Reduction in CO2 emissions, percentage of recycled materials used, community satisfaction scores.

A detailed KPI framework document outlining measurable targets and the monitoring strategy can be found in the /deliverables folder.

Task 2: Project Dashboard Management
The second task involves managing and updating a dynamic project dashboard. This tool serves as the central source of truth for all stakeholders, providing a clear, concise, and visual summary of the project's health.

The dashboard includes:

Progress Tracking: Visual representation of completed milestones against the project timeline.

Budget Analysis: Real-time tracking of expenditure against the allocated budget.

Risk & Issue Log: A summary of identified risks, their potential impact, and the status of mitigation efforts.

KPI Status: A snapshot of the current performance against the defined Safety, Efficiency, and Sustainability KPIs.
